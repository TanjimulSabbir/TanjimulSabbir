## 🌍 **Hello, World!** 👋  
_"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad."_  
— Cory House  

Hi, I’m **Tanjimul Islam Sabbir**, a passionate **Front-End Developer** who thrives on creating **intuitive, responsive, and performant** web applications. I love solving problems, simplifying complexity, and translating ideas into seamless user experiences.  

Currently, I am sharpening my skills in **Data Structures, Algorithms, and React Native** while focusing on **building high-performance, scalable applications**. Problem-solving on **LeetCode** is part of my daily routine as I push myself to **grow as a developer and prepare for technical interviews**.

I’m eager to collaborate with talented teams and contribute to impactful projects. Let’s build something amazing together! 🚀
